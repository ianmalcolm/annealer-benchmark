# TinyQAP

I construct these randomly generated QAP problem of size from 3 to 12. 

I start the problem generation by randomly generating $n$ points in a two-dimensional space using ``np.random.rand`` from NumPy with a random seed of 1234. The $n$ points are saved with ``coord`` extension in the filename. Each line is consisted of x and y coordinate of a point. The distance adjacency matrix is generated based on the list of points. 

For the generation of the flow matrix, I generate $F_{n\times n}=(m+m.T) / 2$, where $m$ is an $n\times n$ matrix generated by the same random method. I set the diagonal of $F_{n\times n}$ to be zero to eliminate loops.

Every ``dat`` file start with line describing the size of the problem, and includes a distance matrix and a flow matrix. They follow the format convention of the famous QAPLIB.

Reference solutions found by Gurobi 9.1 on a tower server equipped with an Intel Core i9-10900X CPU, 128GB DDR4 memory and 128GB HDD swap memory. Gurobi is allowed to instantiate 20 threads and occupy almost all CPU time slices and memory resources.
